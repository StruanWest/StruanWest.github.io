        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
        <div class = "description-text">
            My name is Struan West, I am Scottish and I am 23 years old. I am currently in the fourth and final year of my Interactive Media college course with UHI. I am passionate about creating games and I'm hoping to go on to be a game designer. I have experience in making games with the Unity engine and have previously entered in the Game Jam 192: Episode 4 where I finished in fourth place.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also have some experience in video editing. In 2023, I went to Elgin to record and edit videos for the Moray Game Jam as well as help handle the social media for the event through Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. I was also helped build the Moray Game Jam website with the other students on the course.

                <p>
                    When I was young, I would spend most of my time playing games on the family computer before my brother was given a PlayStation 2 for his birthday. I would end up taking it over and spending a lot of time on games like Simpsons Hit & Run. It's around this time where my love of video games really blossmed, leading me to pursue creating my own games.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 2018 I left secondary school which is when I signed up to join the UHI. My course taught me how to make websites, pass data around the internet and eventually, how to make games. So far I have developed, two 2D games, one 3D game and one VR game.

                <p class="section-title">THE UNRELIABLE SAT NAV</p>
                <p>
                    This was my entry for the Game Jam 192: Episode 4. The theme was "The Unreliable Narrator". I then interpreted the narrator being someone who told you what to do or where to go, hence "The Unreliable Sat Nav".
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The music paired with the Sat Nav's commentery was used to intentionally irritate the player. I felt this would work with the annoying sat nav without frustrating the player to the point where they want to quit. I also added multiple endings (as indicated by the stars on the menu screen).

                    <br>
                    This game was made using the Unity engine.

                <p class="section-title">BOWLING VR GAME</p>
                <p>
                    This was my first time creating a VR game. Again, this was a college project, so I decided to try something simple while also adding in a personal twist. Instead of just simple bowling, I added in game tools which could be used in various ways to knock down the pins, including a golf club and gun.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was made using the Unity engine and a Meta Quest 2 headset. In the end, I think it's a fun little game and I plan to explore VR more with other projects in future.

                    This is my first fully developed and polished game demo. All assets (excluding the music) were created by me.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was made as part of my dissertation project for the UHI and as of making this site, it is not yet finished. From the games I've made so far, I feel most proud of this project.
